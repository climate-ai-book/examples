    └── README.mdKey Concepts and Equations1. Information Theory

Mutual Information: I(X;Y) = Σ p(x,y) log(p(x,y)/(p(x)p(y)))
Entropy: H(X) = -Σ p(x)log p(x)
Application: Understanding climate variable relationships
2. Neural Network Architectures

Convolutional Neural Networks for spatial climate fields
LSTM networks for temporal climate sequences
Transformer models for attention-based climate prediction
3. Physics-Informed Neural Networks

Loss function: L = L_data + λ_pde*L_pde + λ_bc*L_bc
Incorporates physical constraints (conservation laws, PDEs)
Ensures physically consistent predictions
4. Multi-Scale Analysis

Wavelet transform: W(a,b) = (1/√a) ∫ f(t)ψ*((t-b)/a) dt
Dilated convolutions for multi-resolution processing
Captures climate phenomena across different scales
