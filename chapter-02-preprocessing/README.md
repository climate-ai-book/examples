    └── README.mdKey Concepts and Equations1. Information Theory for Preprocessing

Differential Entropy: H(X) = -∫ p(x)log p(x) dx
Mutual Information: I(X;Y) = ∫∫ p(x,y)log(p(x,y)/(p(x)p(y))) dx dy
KL Divergence for bias detection
2. Missing Data Mechanisms

MCAR: P(M|Y,ψ) = P(M|ψ)
MAR: P(M|Y,ψ) = P(M|Y_obs,ψ)
MNAR: P(M|Y,ψ) = P(M|Y_obs,Y_mis,ψ)
3. Matrix Completion Theory

Nuclear norm minimization: min ||Z||_* subject to Z_ij = X_ij, (i,j)∈Ω
Low-rank matrix recovery with theoretical guarantees
4. Bayesian Imputation

Posterior predictive distribution for missing values
Uncertainty quantification in imputation
5. Change-Point Detection

Bayesian change-point analysis
Wavelet-based stationarity tests
Spectral analysis of non-stationarity
6. Physics-Informed Preprocessing

Conservation law constraints (mass, energy, momentum)
Thermodynamic consistency (ideal gas law, hydrostatic balance)
Constrained optimization framework
7. Multi-Scale Analysis

Kolmogorov energy cascade: E(k) = C_K ε^(2/3) k^(-5/3)
Discrete wavelet transform
Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)
8. Quality Control

M-estimators and Huber loss
Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution
Physical constraint-based outlier detection

Copula-based multivariate correction
Domain adaptation theory
